# Horiseon Landing Page

The updated landing page for Horiseon contains changes that enhance web accessibility. Through careful design and thoughtful consideration of accessibility standards, we have made sure that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can easily navigate and engage with our content. The site now contains improved contrast ratios through color changes, semantic HTML elements, updated font sizes, role callouts, and optimized alt text for images.
